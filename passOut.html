<p><strong>As soon as you step in, you realize that you are in an abandoned, old hotel. Before you can say anything, 
after taking a few steps, you hear loud static in your ear, and you pass out. You regain your consciousness soon after, but 
something is horribly wrong. Everything around you is pitch black. Your hands are tied in front of you, and by the feeling of it,
 your clothes are gone. You are kneeling on the ground, and you can hear a loud, raspy breathing noise inside the room with you. However, 
 there is a key right in front of you on the ground. On further inspection, the inscription on the key says &lsquo;DOOR&rsquo;, and you can make out a 
 thin stream of light coming from a door a few feet away from you. What do you do? </strong></div>

<div id="box-set">
  <a href="Death.html"><div id="box1">Assume its your friend who is breathing and shout out &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;.</div></a>
 <a href="Death.html"> <div id="box2">Nah. I&rdquo;ll just go back to sleep. Besides, I don&rdquo;t want to run around naked in the building. </div></a>
 <a href="corridorChainsaw.html"> <div id="box2">Grab the key, run for the door and unlock it. And then heavily improvise.</div></a>
