<p><strong>Dropping it like itâ€™s hot, huh? Smart move. 
As you turn the corridor, you hear another loud squeal of delight, followed by a squeak from the toy. 
You open the door to the room, and hey presto. There is the can of fuel you needed. 
You grab it, feeling hopeful. Suddenly, your friend opens the door behind you, smiling widely. 
He tells you to follow him quickly. As you leave, you notice that the air ventilation cover on the corridor is shredded open. 
Nightmare is on the loose. </strong></div>
