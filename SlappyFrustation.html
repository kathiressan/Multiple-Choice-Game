<p><strong>Both of you slam the door open and begin running for your lives. 
You can hear Slappy shouting in frustration, but he does not give chase. 
You discover that you are now in the underground car park. 
Suddenly you can hear Slappy&rsquo;s loud laughter echoing throughout the entire building. 
Which means, whatever other creatures in the building can hear the commotion, and they are after you. 
Where do you plan to go now?</strong></div>
