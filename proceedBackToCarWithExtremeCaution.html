<p><strong>As you head back down the corridor, you notice a high quality night vision camera on the ground. 
It can help you see better in the dark, as the flashlight batteries were long gone. You want to pick it up, but your friend says no. 
He says he doesn’t like wasting time, and there is no need for thermal cameras right now. 
He is acting a little weird, isn’t he?</strong></div>

  <a href="takeNightVisionCamera.html"><div id="box1">Take the camera. Might be wasting time, but what the heck?</div></a>

 <a href="vehiclebreaksdown.html"> <div id="box2">Just leave the camera. We’re nearly out of here. It’s pretty much over, so why bother?</div></a>
