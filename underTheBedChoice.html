<p><strong>Your heart sinks as you hear pretty much nothing. 
You cannot see what&rsquo;s going on outside because the skirting of the bed prevents you from doing so. 
The door suddenly creaks open slowly. The temperature in the room drops, and the lights go dim. 
You can hear the faint sounds of a young girl sobbing. You stay still, figuring out what to do next. Are you scared?</strong></div>

  <a href="Death.html"><div id="box1">Hell yeah. Who wouldn&rsquo;t be? I guess I&rsquo;d better flick on the torch light, 
  get up and run for my life right now. God help me.</div></a>
 <a href="keepCalmUnderTheBedChoice.html"> <div id="box2">No. I must remain strong. Even if I&rsquo;m stark naked and I might die if I 
 stay here for too long. Just. Keep. Calm. And try not to pee my pants. If I had any.</div></a>
