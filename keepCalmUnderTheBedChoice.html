<p><strong>You take a small peek from underneath the skirting. Through the crack, 
there was not much you can see. You look to the left of the room, and there it was. 
You can see a pair of legs, pale white, shuffling slowly from the bathroom to the closet. 
The closet door slowly opened. More sobbing. Then, the legs shuffle to the door, and whatever that was has left the room.</strong></div>
