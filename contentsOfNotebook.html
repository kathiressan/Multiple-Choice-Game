<p style="font-family:Chiller; font-size:40px;">Leatherface  &ndash; Wears a mask of human skin, pretty much invulnerable, has keen sense of sight, and weilds 
a chainsaw. Has super stamina and super strength.</p>


	  
<p style="font-family:Chiller; font-size:40px;">Crying Child &ndash; A small girl who was brutally beaten up by a group of cruel girls because they didn&rsquo;t like 
the fact that she couldn&rsquo;t speak English properly. Long hair, floating a few feet from the 
ground, faceless expression, pool of blood, weeping-you get the idea. She can smell fear, 
can teleport over short distances, and will grow extra appendages to attack and kill.</p>

cult and are now possessed by demons. They are looking for human victims to feed 
themselves. They make loud creaking noises when walking, and are armed with razor sharp 
claws and teeth. They will scream and laugh very loudly when he sees you.</p>

		  
<p style="font-family:Chiller; font-size:40px;">The Twins &ndash; The creature appears to be a conjoined set of Siamese twins that are covered in black cloak. 
They walk on two human hands, and are very large. However, they do not attack much, they 
just roam just roam around looking for toys and people to play with. However when they get 
mad, the twins move very fast to catch and crush its prey.</p>


<p style="font-family:Chiller; font-size:40px;">Nightmare &ndash; The most dangerous of all creatures in the building. It can take the form of anyone to get close, deceive its prey and ambush it. However it can be spotted by using a thermal camera, where 
Nightmare will not show a very high thermal reading.</p>
